# GitHub Release Monitor

Have you ever found it difficult to keep up with the growing number of open source libraries and projects on GitHub? Tons of new, interesting projects are being added to GitHub daily, and existing projects are constantly being updated at a rapid pace. Keeping track of all the releases for all the repositories we might contribute to, use, and/or rely on for our own projects is an overwhelming task. That's why I created this tool, GitHub Release Monitor, so you would never have to miss another release for your favorite GitHub organizations and repositories again.

This project is built using a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Live

The app is currently live at the following url <https://gh-release-monitor.vercel.app/>.

## Getting Started

The following section will take you through the steps of setting up this project and getting it running locally on your computer.

If you don't want to set up this project locally and just want to see the deployed app, go to <https://gh-release-monitor.vercel.app/>.

1. Download or clone this repository to a local directory on your computer.

2. Change directory to the project root directory (`gh-release-monitor`).

3. If you don't already have Node.js installed on your computer, you can install the latest version from here: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Troubleshooting tip: If you have difficulty starting the app locally, I used node `v14.15.1` when working on this app.

4.Install yarn. Yarn is a package manager like npm used to install the dependencies for this project and start the app locally.

For more information about yarn and other installation options, see the yarn documentation: <https://yarnpkg.com/en/>.

Troubleshooting tip: If you have difficulty starting the app locally, I used yarn `v1.22.10` when working on this app.

5.Change directory into the project root directory (`gh-release-monitor`) and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

6.Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
